### About Me
___
Dr. Saeed Mojtabazadeh is the pioneering geotechnical engineering postdoctoral researcher in Iran, specializing in computational algorithms. Since 2016, Dr. Mojtabazadeh has been dedicated to advanced numerical modeling in seismic geomechanics. His Ph.D. thesis and postdoctoral research focus on investigating SH-wave propagation in orthotropic mediums, along with topographic features, utilizing an exclusive approach known as the Direct Half-Space Time-Domain Boundary Element Method. He has developed multiple numerical approaches, including the Boundary Element Method (BEM), Finite Element Method (FEM), and Hybrid methods, applied to seismic analysis in geotechnical engineering.

### Research & Collaborations
___
My current research focuses on developing machine learning, human-AI interfaces, and sequential decision-making methods to make data-driven and informed decisions for high-impact problems.

My research is motivated by real-world needs and driven by many problems with both practical impact and interesting theoretical challenges. Over the years, I have collaborated closely with healthcare practitioners and hospitals on several projects, spanning from deploying an online Bed Assignment Tool at Michigan Medicine, designing a Prediction Tool for Tracking Glaucoma Progression at Medisoft in the UK, to proposing a new Regulatory Guideline for the FDA's Premarket Approval Pathway.

I am a research fellow at the [Center for the Business of Life Sciences](https://kelley.iu.edu/faculty-research/centers-institutes/business-of-life-sciences/index.html) and a faculty affiliate at the [Institute of Business Analytics](https://kelley.iu.edu/faculty-research/centers-institutes/business-analytics/index.html) at Kelley.
